# Dork_Scanner
just a simple dorkscanner i made some years back, it helped me out with a few things here and there.

Don't mind the old stuff, this was originally on a privately owned git svn.


Please note this is just an old tool. Mainly used for querying search sites with "dorks".
Anyone is free to edit this as they please, but don't piss anyone off =)
